Recently, there is a debate about whether it is necessary for human beings to learn other languages. The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri asserts that children should learn not only commonly used languages like English but also parents’ native languages. However in “The New Language Landscape” by Reshma Krishnamurthy Sharma, Sharma claims that learning a universal language is favorable for children when adapting to the globalized society. Additionally, “Passing the Test” by James Angelos notes that governments requires people to learn new languages when they move to new countries along with the immigration surge in Europe. To limit the number of immigrants, many European countries accept immigrants who pass pre-entry language tests. Then, to what extent are pre-entry tests valuable to assess one’s eligibility of immigration? Although one could argue that language learning results in the loss of local cultures, language learning could be positive for different groups by creating a sense of belonging, family harmony, and helping one adapt to a culture different than their native one.
